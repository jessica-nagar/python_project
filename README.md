Creating a Discord Bot with multiple functions.

When a member joins the server it will welcome them in the 'welcome' channel.

When a member leaves the server it will say goodbye to them in the 'welcom' channel.

These are different than when someone physically joins or leaves the channel. These are used to chat with the bot.

    When a member prompts the bot with '$hello' the bot will respond with 1 of the 3 ways to say hello.

    When a member prompts the bot with '$bye' the bot will respond with 1 of the 3 ways to say goodbye.

When a member prompts the bot with '$version' it will display the version information in the 'bot-tests' channel.



As of the momement: 

    Mary is working on the music bot part.

    I (Jessica) have been working on the overall functionality of having everything run in one file and adding some more prompts to the 'message bot'.
